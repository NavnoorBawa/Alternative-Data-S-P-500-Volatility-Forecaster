# Alternative Data S&P 500 Volatility Forecaster

A sophisticated volatility forecasting system that combines traditional financial data with alternative data sources through an enhanced GARCH-MIDAS framework to predict S&P 500 volatility over a 22-day business horizon.

## üéØ Overview

This system forecasts S&P 500 volatility by integrating satellite imagery, news sentiment, and real-time economic indicators with traditional market data. The model uses a hybrid GARCH-MIDAS architecture to capture both short-term market dynamics and long-term volatility trends driven by alternative data signals.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-source data integration**: Combines traditional market data with satellite intelligence, news sentiment, and economic indicators
- **Advanced modeling**: GARCH-MIDAS framework with jump detection and robust estimation
- **Real-time forecasting**: 22-business-day volatility predictions with confidence intervals
- **Alternative data innovation**: First-of-its-kind integration of satellite imagery and advanced NLP in volatility modeling
- **Production ready**: Multi-API architecture with comprehensive validation frameworks

## üìä Data Sources

### Traditional Market Data
- S&P 500 price and volume data with technical indicators
- Realized volatility calculations using jump-robust estimators
- Moving averages, momentum indicators, and trend signals

### Satellite Intelligence
- **Port Activity Analysis**: Monitoring major shipping hubs (LA, NY, Shanghai, Rotterdam, Singapore)
- **Economic Activity**: Nightlight intensity analysis in metropolitan areas
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Thermal signature analysis from key industrial zones

### News Sentiment Analysis
- Financial news processing using FinBERT transformer models
- Confidence-weighted sentiment scoring across multiple news providers
- Real-time sentiment trend analysis with source reliability weighting

### Economic Indicators
- Real-time economic data from institutional sources
- Macroeconomic indicators with appropriate temporal lags

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Model Components

#### GARCH Component (Short-term Dynamics)
- Multiple GARCH specifications: standard GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH
- Student-t distributions for robust estimation
- Jump detection algorithms for extreme market movements

#### MIDAS Component (Long-term Trends)
- Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with Beta polynomial weighting
- Alternative data feature integration
- Long-term volatility trend capture

#### Feature Selection
- Adaptive Lasso regression with source-specific weighting
- Maintains model parsimony while ensuring comprehensive signal capture
- Enforces minimum representation from all alternative data sources

### Temporal Integration

Different data sources operate on optimized temporal frequencies:

| Data Source         | Lag Period |             Rationale               |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Market Data         | 4 days     | Technical feature stability         |
| News Sentiment      | 1 day      | Near real-time market sentiment     |
| Satellite Data      | 7 days     | Processing and transmission delays  |
| Economic Indicators | 22 days    | Institutional reporting schedules   |

### Volatility Synthesis

The final forecast combines components through:

```
œÉ‚Çú = ‚àö(g‚Çú¬≤ √ó œÑ‚Çú)
```

Where:
- `g‚Çú` = GARCH-derived short-term volatility component
- `œÑ‚Çú` = MIDAS-derived long-term trend factor with alternative data signals

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Multi-API Architecture
- Real-time data fusion from 5 distinct API sources
- Source-specific processing pipelines
- Redundancy and reliability safeguards

### Bias Control System
